## Description

The PBMCs were loaded onto the 10× Chromium Single Cell Platform (10X Genomics) (5' and V(D)J Enrichment) as described in the manufacturer’s protocol. Generation of gel beads in emulsion (GEMs), barcoding, GEM-RT clean-up, complementary DNA amplification, and library construction were all performed as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Qubit was used for library quantification before pooling. The final library pool was sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 using 150 base-pair paired-end reads. The cellranger pipeline (version 6.1.1) was applied to analyze the sequencing raw data, with references of the transcriptome (GRCh38-3.0.0) and VDJ repertoire (vdj_GRCh38_alts_ensembl-4.0.0).
